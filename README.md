"# Automatic Surveillance" 
Auto Surveillance using Deep learning | Python, Flask, Javascript 
• Developed an automated surveillance system using a spatio-temporal autoencoder with 3D CNNs for real-time
anomaly detection in video frames.
• Implemented a reconstruction loss mechanism to detect suspicious activities like theft, violence, and potential
explosions.
• Built and deployed the system using Flask and Python 3.6, enabling scalable surveillance across multiple locations
for improved security.
